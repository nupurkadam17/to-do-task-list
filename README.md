# to-do-task-list
A simple Python console app to manage daily tasks — add, complete, view, and delete to-dos.

🔧 Features

➕ Add Tasks — Add new tasks to your to-do list

✅ Mark as Completed — Keep track of finished tasks

🗑 Delete Tasks — Remove tasks you no longer need

📋 View All Tasks — See both completed and pending tasks

🔍 View Incomplete Tasks Only — Focus on what’s left to do

🧠 How It Works
The application uses a simple loop to display a menu and handle user input. Each task is stored along with its status (completed or not), making it easy to track progress.
