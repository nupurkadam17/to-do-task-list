# 📝 To-Do Task List

A simple Python console app to manage daily tasks — add, complete, view, and delete to-dos.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ➕ **Add Tasks** — Add new tasks to your to-do list  
- ✅ **Mark as Completed** — Keep track of finished tasks  
- 🗑️ **Delete Tasks** — Remove tasks you no longer need  
- 📋 **View All Tasks** — See both completed and pending tasks  
- 🔍 **View Incomplete Tasks** — Focus only on what's left to do  

---

## 🛠️ How It Works

The app uses a Python loop to:
- Display a menu
- Handle user input
- Store each task with its **status** (completed or not) in memory

All tasks are stored in a list as dictionaries or tuples.
